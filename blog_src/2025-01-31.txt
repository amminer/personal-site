Test Blog Post Title
/images/bice.jpg
This is a test blog post. I intend to use the first line as the title, the second line as a filename
for an image if any, and the rest of the file as the post content. I hope that raw HTML can be
included in the post content to make things potentially very spicy. Let's see if it works.

<br/><br/><span style="color: red;">It really is just HTML in here!</span>
Cool.
