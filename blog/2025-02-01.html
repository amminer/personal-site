            <p class="blog_post_text"> This is a second test blog post. I'm going to deploy this to my static site host to make sure their
web server treats it how I expect it to be treated.

You may be asking yourself - why did I decide to write this funky little hack for publishing my
blog? I'm so glad you asked!<br/><br/>

There are probably hundreds of existing tools that I could have used to accomplish something not
just functionally equivalent to this, but probably functionally superior in a lot of ways,
with their own schemas and conventions and quirks. Many of these tools have solved
all of the problems I've encountered as I worked on this, solved more, and solved them in better ways.
However, I feel that the benefits of whipping something up from scratch outweigh my code's 
deficits in its current state as I've patched it together.
Since my solution is just a handful of state and an algorithm around it, the whole process will slot
more easily into new hosting environments and tweaks to the website around it, integrates with existing
site resources easily, eliminates substantial dependencies, and has potential to eliminate many of
its aforementioned deficiencies as I learn and decide on how to put a little more care into
developing it and updating my site.<br/><br/>

Ultimately, I also just found it fun to write, and I'd rather be returning to sharpening some
web front end skills, learning a little about jinja 2, and writing good old python than committing to a
new tool that's built to do a lot more than what I need it to do, but who knows, maybe if I start
writing here more I'll end up switching over to something different.<br/><br/>

At this point the site is updated as follows:<br/>
    1. I write a blog post into a text file on my machine<br/>
    2. I run scripts/generate_blog.py, which updates blog.html and blog_posts/<br/>
    3. I commit and push to main the change to blog.html and the new file(s) or changes in
    blog_posts/<br/>
    4. GitHub webhooks to my static site host<br/>
    5. My static site host publishes the new html files<br/><br/>

When a client loads blog.html, the most recent post is at the top of the list in the sidebar pane
and is displayed in the content pane. When the user selects a post in the sidebar, it's requested
from the server and loaded by javascript on their client into the content pane so that the client
only has to load one post at a time and the sidebar doesn't have to reload.<br/><br/>

Blog posts have a title, an optional header image filepath from repo root, and a body that's a sort
of subset of HTML (lists don't behave well, for example, and I'm not totally clear on why) on the
first, second, and third-through-final lines, respectively. Blog posts are stored in files in the
blog_src/ directory, with filenames corresponding to the date of the post formatted yyyy-mm-dd.txt
(one per day at most). I may choose to do proper markdown for the bodies at some point, and that's
kind of where the beauty is in a hacked up setup like this - it's as easy as possible to just get
started dropping new features or conventions in as needed.
